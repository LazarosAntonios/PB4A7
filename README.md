📝 Course Description
Quantitative data collection is the cornerstone of behavioural science. This course, Quantitative Applications in Behavioural Science, aims to equip you with the statistical tools and methodologies commonly used in psychology and economics. Unlike another core course—Experimental Design and Methods for Behavioural Science—which focuses on the design of experiments, this course dives into the statistical background essential for behavioural research.

🎯 Learning Objectives
Understand the fundamentals of data science and its application in social sciences.
Master statistical tools used by psychologists and economists.
Conduct and report your own data analysis for journal publication.
Recognize and address contemporary issues in data science analysis in psychology and economics.

🛠️ Requirements
Software: Download and install STATA or R and R Studio.
Student Hours: Book office hours for Dr. Melios & Ms. Odell via Student Hub.
Class Participation: Active participation and punctuality are highly recommended.

📚 Recommended Materials
Material Type	Examples
Books	"The Effect Book" by Nick C. Huntington-Klein, "Introduction to Econometrics" by James H. Stock & Mark W. Watson
Videos	Various online tutorials and podcasts
Cheat Sheets	STATA and R coding cheat sheets

📊 Assessment
The course assessment is divided into two parts:
Data Analysis Report replicating an existing paper (70%)
Poster Presentation summarizing the report (30%)

🗓️ Course Outline
The course is structured into weekly sessions, each focusing on a specific topic such as Linear Regressions, Hypothesis Testing, and more. Required and optional readings are assigned to deepen your understanding.

🌟 Final Thoughts
By the end of this course, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of the quantitative methods used in behavioural science. You'll be well-equipped to integrate research findings from psychology and economics, thereby contributing to the multidisciplinary field of behavioural science. 🎉
