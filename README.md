📝 Course Description
Quantitative data collection is the cornerstone of behavioural science. This course, Quantitative Applications in Behavioural Science, aims to equip you with the statistical tools and methodologies commonly used in psychology and economics. Unlike another core course—Experimental Design and Methods for Behavioural Science—which focuses on the design of experiments, this course dives into the statistical background essential for behavioural research.

🎯 Learning Objectives
Understand the fundamentals of data science and its application in social sciences.
Master statistical tools used by psychologists and economists.
Conduct and report your own data analysis for journal publication.
Recognize and address contemporary issues in data science analysis in psychology and economics.
🛠️ Requirements
Software: Download and install STATA or R and R Studio.
Student Hours: Book office hours for Dr. Melios & Ms. Odell via Student Hub.
Class Participation: Active participation and punctuality are highly recommended.
