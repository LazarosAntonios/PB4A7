## Indicative Reading

This week's indicative reading: [@james_introduction_2021, chapter 2, 2.1-2.2]

## Recommended (additional) reading

**What are different ways one can approach a modelling problem?**

Checkout the upcoming book ['Modeling Mindsets'](https://book.modeling-mindsets.com/) [@molnar_modeling_2022, chapters 2-3] (it's free to read online) to learn about the traditional frequentist statistics vs Bayesian statistics vs Machine Learning approaches.

The following twitter thread also summarises the main points of these different paradigms:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In a perfect world, you could effortlessly switch between modeling mindsets (statistics, machine learning, causal inference, ...).<br><br>Realistically, you only have time to master a few mindsets.<br><br>So what to do?
